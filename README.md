This is a maintained **GTK+ 2 version**
of [gucharmap](https://github.com/GNOME/gucharmap).

---

It is based on gucharmap version 3.0.1 which was the last version still
supporting GTK+ 2.

All relevant patches since, such as bug fixes, user interface translations
and, most importantly, all Unicode additions, are backported from the
[latest gucharmap](https://github.com/GNOME/gucharmap/commits/master)
version.

Therefore this GTK+ 2 version has full (i.e. current) Unicode support and
continues to use the GNU build system (autotools) and configure.

It is released under the same license as gucharmap itself.
